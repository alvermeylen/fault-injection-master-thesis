This is the code of the fault injection tool developped in the context of a master thesis submitted for the Master’s degree
in computer science (120 credits) at the Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL) by Alex Vermeylen. 

Note that, due to confidentiality, a part of the source code related to the cunit support was not provided on this public repository. Therefore, the cunit option should not be used.

To run the tool, configure the injection-strategies.properties file in the hardening forlder and run the run.py file with the correct arguments.

The documentation of the tool, which contains the informations necessary to run the tool correctly is provided in the doc.pdf file.
